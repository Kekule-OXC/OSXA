# OSXA
The OSXA repository contains the design files for an addon to the original xbox video game console. The design is based on the LC4064V CPLD from Lattice Semiconductors and the SST49LFXX0X line of LPC flash devices from Microchip. It includes both the hardware (schematic and layout) and software (vhdl sources) required for its implementation.
